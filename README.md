# Sample

Implementation of https://github.com/apegroup/Code-test?tab=readme-ov-file

```
Assumptions
    1. Number of filters is dynamic: unique set of all filters is shown
    2. No use of thirdparty libraries
    3. SwiftUI + Combine
    4. Xcode Version 15.3
    
What is left
    1. Networking layer: 
        1. API calls to fetch filter names for each filter id
        2. API call for open status
2. Screenshot tests, Unit tests, etc.
3. An asset for “Take out” where not available for export, reused the one for “Top Rated”
```
